                                        So the bar is where I go
                                        Me and my friends at the table doing shots
                                        Drinking fast and then we talk slow
                                        Come over and start up a conversation with just me
                                        And trust me I'll give it a chance now
                                        Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
                                        And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
                                        Girl, you know I want your love
                                        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
                                        Come on now, follow my lead
                                        I may be crazy, don't mind me
                                        Say, boy, let's not talk too much
                                        Grab on my waist and put that body on me
                                        Come on now, follow my lead
                                        Come, come on now, follow my lead
                                        I'm in love with the shape of you
                                        We push and pull like a magnet do
                                        Although my heart is falling too
                                        I'm in love with your body
                                        And last night you were in my room
                                        And now my bedsheets smell like you
                                        Every day discovering something brand new
                                        I'm in love with your body
                                        Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
                                        I'm in love with your body

                                        I'm in love with the shape of you
                                        One week in we let the story begin
                                        We're going out on our first date
                                        You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
                                        Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
                                        We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
                                        And how your family is doing okay
                                        Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
                                        Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
                                        Girl, you know I want your love
                                        Your love was handmade for somebody like me
